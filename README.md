# BrainCancerDetection
This is a project that uses Convolutional Neural Networks, that is made using Tensorflow and Keras to classify 4 different types of Brain Cancers. They are glioma tumors,  meningioma tumors, no tumors, and pituitary tumors. 


# Next Steps:

- Use the predictions of the model for real-time predictions
- Experiment with different model architectures for optimal performance
