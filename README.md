# BrainCancerDetection
This is a project that uses Convolutional Neural Networks, that is made using Tensorflow and Keras to classify 4 different types of Brain Cancers. They are glioma tumors,  meningioma tumors, no tumors, and pituitary tumors. This is the initial version of my CNN, I will be updating the code. The performance of this model was about 50% for the training accuracy. Although this is not a very optimal accuracy, I learned that classifiying brain tumors is quite difficult for machine learning projects, and a lot of refinement of the data would be required. Not only that, but I would have to use different methods of classification as at times the model can mistake tumors for different parts of the brain that are in our anatomy. Overall, this was a great learning experience and my hope is do Brain Cancer Segmentation for better results along with other algorithms to increase the acuraccy of the model.


# Next Steps:

- Use the model for real-time predictions
- Experiment with different model architectures for optimal performance
- Use different algorithms to make it easier for the model to classify brain tumors
- Use Segmentation to locate where the tumor are in the brain
