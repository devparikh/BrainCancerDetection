# BrainCancerDetection
This is a project that uses Convolutional Neural Networks, that is made using Tensorflow and Keras to classify 4 different types of Brain Cancers. They are glioma tumors,  meningioma tumors, no tumors, and pituitary tumors. This is the initial version of my CNN, I will be updating the code. I am currently working on making the training faster and optimization of the model.


# Next Steps:

- Use the model for real-time predictions
- Experiment with different model architectures for optimal performance
