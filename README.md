# BrainCancerDetection
This is a project that I made using Tensorflow and Keras to classify 4 different types of Brain Cancers. They are glioma tumors,  meningioma tumors, no tumors, and pituitary tumors. I used a Convolutional Neural Network to make this project. I am going to continue to optimize the model for maximum accuracy by trying different model architectures.
