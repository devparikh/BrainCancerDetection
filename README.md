# BrainCancerDetection
This is a project that uses Convolutional Neural Networks, that is made using Tensorflow and Keras to classify 4 different types of Brain Cancers. They are glioma tumors,  meningioma tumors, no tumors, and pituitary tumors. This is the initial version of my CNN, I will be updating the code. The performance of this model was about 50% for the training accuracy. I am currently working on implementing a number of techniques in order for me to better preprocess the data so that that the model can performance substancially better.

# Next Steps:

- Use the model for real-time predictions
- Experiment with different model architectures for optimal performance
- Use different techniques in order to be able to do special preprocessing so that this data is enhanced and the model can achieve greater accuracies
